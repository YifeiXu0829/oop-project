# pre-requirements: #

**use draw.io to open UML.xml for uml graph**

in postgresql:

**login as user postgres**

psql -U postgres

**create database and tables**

CREATE DATABASE regie;

CREATE TABLE accounts (
        user_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR ( 50 ) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL,
        role VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
        course_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
        course_name VARCHAR (100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        capacity INT NOT NULL,
        instructor VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

**populate some pre-saved database info**

insert into accounts(username,password,role) values('yifeix','yifeix','A');

insert into accounts(username,password,role) values('terry','terry','T');

libraries requirements:

please follow https://github.com/jtv/libpqxx to install libpqxx, the C++ API to the PostgreSQL database management system.

also, please make sure your compiler support c++20. (please check CMakeLists.txt for details)


# Iteration 1: #

Identified bounded context problem domains.
1. account manager that operates on user information, such as validate_credential(login), add/delete/modify user info, register/drop course for a specific user, etc.

2. course manager that operates on courses information, such as add/modify/delete/find/list course info, etc.

3. a role(or user) interface defines which role the current user is, what permissions the current role(user) has etc.

4. a database interface class that relates all operations performed through database.

5. a controller class that serves as a information exchange hub for the above objects to easily communicate with each other without tightly coupled.

# Iteration 2: #

Use Liskov substitution principle and Openâ€“closed principle to create the User Interface, and use factory method to ensure the concrete class type which will be initialized is depended on which role type it is told by account_manager. Thus role/permissions will be decided on run-time by which concreate instance is initilized (Please check UML.xml for detailed structure). each concrete type is bounded by its available permissions, but extensible if another role extends it.

added concrete class account_manager and course_manager, use Single-responsibility principle to define each class's functionality.

# Iteration 3: #

added database_access_Interface which relates database access operations. Use Interface segregation principle that database_access_Interface is implemented by course_tables_access and account_tables_access. course_tables_access relates database operations only regarding courses table, and account_tables_access relates database operations onlu regarding accounts table. Thus account_manager class will composite an account_tables_access instance. and course_manager class will composite a course_tables_access instance. Thus each client is only exposed to database operations delegates with their own context.

# Introduction #

This is a framework of school course registration system called Regie.
(See UML.xml (draw.io to open) for details as mentioned below)
It is composed of 5 components:
1. Account Manager
2. Course Manager
3. User Interface
4. Controller
5. database_access_interface

User interface defines a user's permission based on their role. The pre-defined roles are listed in roles.h, which includes five roles: admin, stident, TA, faculty and instructor.
and pre-defined permissions are coded in user.h as final class for close modification purpose.
To add another role and define the permissions, simply entends the corrsponding base role class and add their special permissions (or override existing permissions), then add the new role in the user factory class for contructing purpose.

permissions are related to two types of management
1. account manager
    related with user information, such as login_credentials, registered courses, user_role  etc.
2. course manager
    related with posted courses infomation, such as course_name, course_instructor, course_capacity etc.

### Database Use Choice ###

for account manager usage, its data is relatively unstructured, such as the field of registered-courses etc. We decided to use NoSql database (leveldb).

for course manager usage, its data is rather structured. We decided to use PostgresSql for course manager operations.

Database access have a common interface, and applying Interface segregation principle, implemented two interfaces which are account_tables_access and course_tables_access for specific client only be exposed to coressponding operations. If more operations related with the two existing manager, you can add it in the coressponding interface.

Lastly, controller acts as operation hub to let different instance communicate with each other without tightly coupled.
